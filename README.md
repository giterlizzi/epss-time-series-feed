# EPSS Time Series Feed

This repository contains all EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) values calculated for each CVE.

# About EPSS

> The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. Our goal is to assist network defenders to better prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts. While other industry standards have been useful for capturing innate characteristics of a vulnerability and provide measures of severity, they are limited in their ability to assess threat. EPSS fills that gap because it uses current threat information from CVE and real-world exploit data. The EPSS model produces a probability score between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%). The higher the score, the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited.

## Repository structure

Each CVE gets its own EPSS file, e.g., `CVE-1999-0001.epss`. Here, each file is put into a folder layout that first sorts by CVE year identifier part and then by number part. We mask (xx) the last two digits to create easily navigable folders that hold a maximum of 100 EPSS files:

```
.
├── CVE-1999
│   ├── CVE-1999-00xx
│   │   ├── CVE-1999-0001.epss
│   │   ├── CVE-1999-0002.epss
│   │   └── [...]
│   ├── CVE-1999-01xx
│   │   ├── CVE-1999-0101.epss
│   │   └── [...]
│   └── [...]
├── CVE-2000
│   ├── CVE-2000-00xx
│   ├── CVE-2000-01xx
│   └── [...]
└── [...]
```

## Feed file format

The current fields in the EPSS feed:

* `date` : EPSS date
* `model` : EPSS model
* `epss` : the EPSS score representing the probability [0-1] of exploitation in the wild in the next 30 days (following score publication)
* `percentile` : the percentile of the current score, the proportion of all scored vulnerabilities with the same or a lower EPSS score

EPSS Model:

* No scores are available before 2021-04-14
* EPSS v2 (v2022.01.01) started publishing on 2022-02-04, you will see a major shift in most scores on that day
* EPSS v3 (v2023.03.01) started publishing on 2023-03-07, you will see a shift in scores on that day
* EPSS v4 (v2025.03.14) started publishing on 2025-03-17, you will see a shift in scores on that day

## Usage

### Clone the Repository (without Git History)

```
git clone --depth 1 -b main https://github.com/giterlizzi/epss-time-series-feed.git
```

### Fetch all EPSS data for a single CVE

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giterlizzi/epss-time-series-feed/refs/heads/main/CVE-2021/CVE-2021-442xx/CVE-2021-44228.epss
```

#### Plot data with Gnuplot

Create the `epss.gnuplot` file:

```.gnuplot
input_file  = sprintf('%s.epss', cve_id)
output_file = sprintf('%s-epss.png', cve_id)
title_text  = sprintf('EPSS for %s', cve_id)

set terminal png size 1024,768
set output output_file

set title title_text

set xlabel 'Date'
set ylabel 'Value'

set xdata time
set timefmt '%Y-%m-%d'
set format x '%Y-%m-%d'

set style data linespoints
set grid

set datafile separator ','
set datafile missing 'NaN'

plot input_file using 1:3 with lines title 'EPSS', \
     input_file using 1:4 with lines title 'Percentile'
```

Download the EPSS data for a specific CVE (e.g. `CVE-2021-44228`):

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giterlizzi/epss-time-series-feed/refs/heads/main/CVE-2021/CVE-2021-442xx/CVE-2021-44228.epss
```

Execute `gnuplot` command:

```
gnuplot -e "cve_id='CVE-2021-44228'" epss.gnuplot
```
